# HVAC System Design & 3D Modeling (Autodesk Revit)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive **Mechanical (HVAC) BIM Model** developed using **Autodesk Revit**. It focuses on the precise modeling of air distribution systems and mechanical equipment, ensuring technical accuracy and spatial coordination for a professional engineering workflow.

## 🛠️ Modeling Scope & Features
The project includes the complete 3D modeling of the following components:

* **Ductwork System:** Detailed routing of Supply, Return, and Exhaust air systems.
* **Fittings & Transitions:** Accurate placement of elbows, tees, reducers, and offsets.
* **Duct Insulation:** Applied thermal insulation for energy efficiency and condensation control.
* **Duct Accessories:** Integration of VAV boxes, dampers, and air terminals (diffusers and grilles).
* **Mechanical Equipment:** * **Indoor Units:** Precise placement of FCUs/AHUs within the building layout.
    * **Outdoor Units:** Condensing units modeled with associated refrigerant piping connections.

## 📂 Project Visuals
The repository includes technical views to demonstrate the system layout:
1. **3D Isometric Views:** High-detail visualization of the duct routing and equipment.
2. **Floor Plans:** Annotated mechanical layouts showing duct sizes and equipment tags.
3. **Coordination Views:** Checking clearances between mechanical services and architectural elements.
